# Hello to the teacher reviewing this :)
This implementation was created using the jokes.json version. There is an implementation using just-jokes.json within the commit history if you're intersted in seeing that.

The main difference between the files is the fact that in jokes.json, the jokes is stored within a upper "jokes" entry in the JSON, which changes the approach that I had to use to access the data. 

In jokes.json, i had to access the jokes entry, and then using the index I had to find the joke, before then accessing the "joke" entry.
in just-jokes.json, i only had to use the index to find the joke.

The ID went unused, as I used the index exclusively to find the joke.

The biggest headache was developing the system to display all the jokes, but I think my solution was pretty solid.
